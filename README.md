**NOTE: I am not a SW developer or a coder by trade. I have a little knowledge to be dangerous and have used some skills from my past working life and my hobbyist approach to build this project. 
And YES! a lot of research was needed to help me understand and develop the code, along with some AI suggestions, which to be fair is hard to not do with search engines today.

The tracker has been designed to run locally on your own hardware and network. It hasn't been designed to be exposed to the outside world. I have the Tracker running on a LXC under Proxmox. The HTML file is saved to an SMB share hosted on TrueNAS (where my ARR stack is deployed). The HTML is then accessed via a dashboard. Deployment has been tested via x64 (hence GUI config version) and Linux (config cli version which BTW is cross-platform).

I am happy with it for my needs and will NOT be constantly developing it, sorry 😞. 

I am releasing it to the community AS IS and provide no support or warranty. Use at your own risk.  ALWAYS backup before installing.

So, please be understanding! ☺️.

## ✨ Features

- 📅 **Customisable date range** – Choose how many days past and future to display (configurable).
- 🖼️ **Image caching** – Show posters or fanart are downloaded and stored locally for faster loading. **Fanart is now the default priority**, with fallback to poster and banner. 
- 🎨 **Dark/light theme toggle** – Switch between themes with a click (your choice is saved in your browser).
- 📊 **Overall & per‑show progress** – See at a glance how much of your library is downloaded, and drill down into each series. Badges are used to highlight, Premiere episodes and Season Finale.
- 🏆 **Recently completed seasons** – Shows that finished their current season within the date range are highlighted. Poster is forced for a more professional UI.
- 🔄 **Auto‑refresh mode** – Keep the dashboard running and update periodically (configurable).
- ⌨️ **Graceful interrupt handling** – Press `Ctrl+C` once to exit cleanly, twice to force quit.
- 🌍 **OS‑aware date formatting** – Dates automatically adapt to your system’s locale (e.g. `DD/MM/YYYY` or `MM/DD/YYYY`).
- 🔗 **Direct links to Sonarr** – Click any show card to open its page in Sonarr.
- 🔒 **Secure API key handling** – All API key inputs are masked in real‑time with asterisks.

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python 3.8 or higher** - `requests>=2.28.0` ; `jinja2>=3.1.0` ; `colorama>=0.4.6`   # optional, for cross‑platform coloured output
- **Sonarr** (v3 or v4) with API access
- Operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux (all fully supported)

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KBW1963/sonarr_calendar.git
cd sonarr_calendar
```
### 2.  Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install the package (recommended for easy use)
This creates a command‑line script `sonarr-calendar` that you can run from anywhere.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

### 4. Configure the application
You have a number of ways to create the configuration file:

Option A – Use one of the interactive configuration scripts (recommended). Refer to the config apps folder
```bash
python sonarr_config_cli.py
```

Follow the prompts. The configuration file will be saved in your home directory under `~/.sonarr_calendar_config/` to avoid permission issues.

Option B – Simple GUI tool (if you prefer a graphical interface)
```bash
python sonarr_calendar_config.py
```
This minimal GUI asks for the essential settings (Sonarr URL, API key, output HTML file) and uses sensible defaults for everything else.

Option C – Create the file manually

Create a file named `.sonarr_calendar_config.json` in one of the following locations (searched in order):

- Current working directory
- Same directory as the script (`src/sonarr_calendar/`)
- Parent of the script directory (`src/`)
- Your home directory (`~/.sonarr_calendar_config/`)

Minimal configuration:
```json
{
    "sonarr_url": "http://localhost:8989",
    "sonarr_api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "output_html_file": "sonarr_calendar.html"
}
```
See Configuration for all available options.

### 5.  Run the calendar generator
```bash
# One‑time run. Runs once and exits.
python -m sonarr_calendar --once or python3 -m sonarr_calendar --once

# Auto‑refresh mode. Refreshers based on config setting.
python -m sonarr_calendar or python3 -m sonarr_calendar
```
---
### ⚙️ Configuration
All settings are optional except `sonarr_url` and `sonarr_api_key`. 

Defaults are shown below.

| Field |	Description |	Default
|-------|-------------|---------|
|`sonarr_url`| Your Sonarr instance URL (including port) | required
|`sonarr_api_key`| API key from Sonarr (Settings → General)| required
|`days_past`|Number of past days to include | `7`
|`days_future`|	Number of future days to include| `7` 
|`output_html_file`	| Path where the HTML file will be save	| `sonarr_calendar.html` (in current dir)
|`output_json_file`| Optional JSON output (metadata only)| `null` (no JSON)
|`image_cache_dir`| Directory for cached images	|`sonarr_images` (in current dir)
|`refresh_interval_hours`| Hours between auto‑refreshes	|`6`
|`html_theme`|`dark` or `light`	|`dark`
|`image_quality`|Preferred image type (hint; actual priority is hardcoded: fanart → poster → banner) | `fanart`
|`enable_image_cache`| Whether to cache images locally	|`true` (recommended)
| `html_title` | Browser tab title - `"html_title": "Your title"` | `Sonarr Calendar Pro` (default)

*All fields except `sonarr_url` and `sonarr_api_key` are optional. If omitted, the defaults shown are used. The configuration tools generate a minimal file; you can add additional fields manually to override defaults.*

### 📁 Configuration File Location
The main application searches multiple locations (current directory, script directory, project root, and home directory) so you can place the file wherever convenient.
The configuration script (`sonarr_config_cli.py`) saves the file in your home directory:

- Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\.sonarr_calendar_config\.sonarr_calendar_config.json`
- Linux/macOS: `/home/yourname/.sonarr_calendar_config/.sonarr_calendar_config.json`
---

### 🖼️ Image Priority
The application prioritises fanart images for show cards, providing wider, more scenic artwork. If fanart is not available for a series, it falls back to poster, then banner, and finally any available image.
To force a refresh of cached images, delete the contents of your image_cache_dir and run the generator again.

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
|Problem	|Solution |
|---------|---------|
|`ImportError: No module named jinja2`	|Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
|`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sonarr_calendar'`| Install the package: `pip install -e .`
|Configuration file not found	|Ensure the file exists in one of the search paths. Run `sonarr_config_cli.py` to create it or manually create.
|Sonarr connection failed|	Verify `sonarr_url` and `sonarr_api_key`. Ensure Sonarr is reachable from your machine.
|No episodes shown	|Check your `days_past` and `days_future` settings. The date range might not contain any air dates.
|Images not loading	|Ensure `enable_image_cache` is `true` and the cache directory is writable.
|Permission denied when saving config	|The script now saves to your home directory – this should no longer occur.
|Fanart not downloading	|The image priority is now fanart; if fanart is unavailable, poster is used. Check Sonarr for fanart availability.
